What is implemented so far:
- User registers to the app and with that he has a personal bank account with 0.00 ballance.
- Only the admin can add money to specific account.
- The user can transfer money to accounts(users) of this bank system.
- The system doesn't allow a user to transfer more money than he has on his account.
- The user can see the transactions he has done.
