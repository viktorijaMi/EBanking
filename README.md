- Only certificates signed by the proper CA are accepted.
- User registers to the application and with that he has a personal bank account with 0.00 ballance.
- Only the admin can add money to specific account.
- The user can transfer money to accounts(users) of this bank system.
- The system doesn't allow a user to transfer more money than he has on his account.
- The user can see the transactions he has done.
- Admins can see all the transactions that are made between user accounts.
